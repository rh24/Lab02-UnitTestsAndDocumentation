# Unit Tests And Documentation

This is a mock ATM console application that allows users to withdraw and deposit money into their account. The user may not withdraw past their account balance and but may view their account balance. The user will be prompted to choose one of four actions: view balance, withdraw, deposit, and exit. Users will be prompted to choose an action until choosing "exit."

This project includes a main method and testable external methods. The tests for this application live in the Lab02-Tests directory. In the Program, exceptions will be handled with try, catch, finally, and a throw.
